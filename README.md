# Spotify-App
Use of data extracted from the Spotify streaming platform to create a graphical interface (Tkinter library) giving users access to a certain amount of desired information (artist and song statistics, etc.).


 The data comes from Kaggle and can be downloaded directly from the following link:
- Source 1 : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks
- Source 2 : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sadeghhoushyar/top-200-most-streamed-songs-on-spotify-2020?select=spotify_top200_global.csv

Part 1: Descriptive analysis of databases and visualisation  
Part 2: Content search

The other scripts/images are used to create the interface. The "main (interface).py" script is used to obtain the interface. The interface can also link to the artist's spotify or wikipedia pages.
